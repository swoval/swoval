/**
 * Provides an in memory cache of portions of the file system. Directories are added to the cache
 * using the [[FileTreeRepository.register]] method. Once a Path is added the cache, its
 * contents may be retrieved using the [[FileTreeRepository.list]] method. The cache stores the
 * path information in [[Entry]] instances.
 *
 * <p>A default implementation is provided by [[FileTreeRepositories.get]]. The user may cache
 * arbitrary information in the cache by customizing the [[Converter]] that is passed into the
 * factory [[FileTreeRepositories.get]].
 *
 * <p>The cache allows the user to register a regular file, directory or symbolic link. After
 * registration, the cache should monitor the path (and in the case of symbolic links, the target of
 * the link) for updates. Whenever an update is detected, the cache updates its internal
 * representation of the file system. When that is complete, it will notify all of the registered
 * [[com.swoval.files.Observers]] of the change. In general, the update that is sent in the
 * callback will be visible if the user lists the relevant path. It is however, possible that if the
 * file is being updated rapidly that the internal state of the cache may change in between the
 * callback being invoked and the user listing the path. Once the file system activity settles down,
 * the cache should always end up in a consistent state where it mirrors the state of the file
 * system.
 *
 * <p>The semantics of the list method are very similar to the linux `ls` tool. Listing a directory
 * returns all of the subdirectories and files contained in the directory and the empty list if the
 * directory is empty. Listing a file, however, will return the entry for the file if it exists and
 * the empty list otherwise.
 *
 * @tparam T the type of data stored in the [[Entry]] instances for the cache
